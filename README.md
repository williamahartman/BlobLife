BlobLife

BlobLife is an experiment with Processing. It's like Conway's Game of Life, but more organic looking. All the cells can be placed anywhere in the window. It doesn't use a grid at all.

To make things look cool and blobby, the program blurs the screen and and filters it with a threshold. 

The colors show the lineage of each cell. A cell is the same color as its parent, with a little bit of random variation. 

The UI elements are from Florian Jenett's Guido (here: <https://github.com/fjenett/Guido>).
